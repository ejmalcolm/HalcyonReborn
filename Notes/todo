ROADMAP TO MVG:


0.1.0 -- THE PLAYABLE BUILD

- fix the busy sysytem! currently relies on embedding the sourc ein the payload which causes pickling problems
    - fixable by changing the busy system to the entity function themselves? or maybe have a dedicated busy() function?

- we also have a problem with use_ability: it relies on a unit being in a region, not a territory!
    - solution: rely on the inherent uniqueness of IDs? still have trouble on the interface end
    - probably a better solution is to implement multiple possible arguments into use_ability

- be able to launch from a planets surface

- entity superclass

- actors
    - Start with Automatons only
    - Abilities: move, gather resources, build, enter vehicle

- actor/halcyon interaction
    - Automatons can be produced with a Halcyon ability
    - Halcyon can "carry" Actors from place to place
    - Actors can leave the Halcyon when it's landed

- build the most basic building possible
    - set up basic tag system
    - more to demonstrate resources than anything else 

0.2.0 -- MAKE THINGS NICE

- add cogs organizing commands
- add more interface stuff
    - sub-inspection interfaces, e.g. inspecting Planet opens an interface linked to inspecting Entities
