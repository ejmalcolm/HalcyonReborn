ROADMAP TO MVG:


0.1.0 -- THE PLAYABLE BUILD

- fix the busy sysytem!
    - do it by, as the "source" aspect of the Task() object, putting in a dict that can be broken down to get the source
    - something like "{EID: 'EVANhalcyon', LocType: 'Region', LocExact: (1,1)}
    - {EName: 'EVANhalcyon', LocFile: 'Territory', LocExact: 'PRIMUSnorth'}

- make sure you can only move_region when you're in space

- entity superclass

- actors
    - Start with Automatons only
    - Abilities: move, gather resources, build, enter vehicle
    - ! PROBLEM: how do we deal with having 2 entities of the same type in the same region/territory

- actor/halcyon interaction
    - Automatons can be produced with a Halcyon ability
    - Halcyon can "carry" Actors from place to place
    - Actors can leave the Halcyon when it's landed

- build the most basic building possible
    - set up basic tag system
    - more to demonstrate resources than anything else 

0.2.0 -- MAKE THINGS NICE

- add cogs organizing commands
- add more interface stuff
    - sub-inspection interfaces, e.g. inspecting Planet opens an interface linked to inspecting Entities
- maybe change landed_on to be on territories, not planets
- convert everything to the ID system its cool as fuck
- change the entity_id system
