ROADMAP TO MVG:

THINGS THAT CAME UP
- add checks to abilities
- evaluate if we actually need self.celestial or we can just have a self.territoryID that works for everything


0.1.0 -- THE PLAYABLE BUILD

- entity superclass

- actors
    - Start with Automatons only
    - Abilities: move, gather resources, build, enter vehicle
    - ! PROBLEM: how do we deal with having 2 entities of the same type in the same region/territory

- actor/halcyon interaction
    - Automatons can be produced with a Halcyon ability
    - Halcyon can "carry" Actors from place to place
    - Actors can leave the Halcyon when it's landed

- build the most basic building possible
    - set up basic tag system
    - more to demonstrate resources than anything else 

0.2.0 -- MAKE THINGS NICE

- add cogs organizing commands
- add more interface stuff
    - sub-inspection interfaces, e.g. inspecting Planet opens an interface linked to inspecting Entities
- maybe change landed_on to be on territories, not planets
- convert everything to the LID system its cool as fuck
- change the entity_id system
- convert the LID identification system in Tasks and BotInterface to a function instead of copy/paste
