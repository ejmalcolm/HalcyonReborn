ROADMAP TO MVG:

THINGS THAT CAME UP
- add checks to abilities
- evaluate if we actually need self.celestial or we can just have a self.territoryID that works for everything
- really dont think we need self.celestial but itll be a refactor 4 sure
- change land_on's trigger_func to set_new_territory
- change harvest_time for Harvester to a dictionary, allowing different harvest times for each resource
- for ~inspect entity_name territory, we might be able to remove the celestial and just use the entity's self.celestial for it
- change self.territory for entity to using python's property() to actually return the terr obj

0.1.0 -- THE PLAYABLE BUILD

- build the most basic building possible
    - 3 tags: 
    - more to demonstrate resources than anything else 

- actor/halcyon interaction
    - Halcyon can "carry" Actors from place to place
    - Actors can leave the Halcyon when it's landed

0.2.0 -- MAKE THINGS NICE

- Automatons can be produced with a Halcyon ability
- add cogs organizing commands
- add more interface stuff
    - sub-inspection interfaces, e.g. inspecting Planet opens an interface linked to inspecting Entities
- maybe change landed_on to be on territories, not planets
- convert everything to the LID system its cool as fuck
- change the entity_id system
- convert the LID identification system in Tasks and BotInterface to a function instead of copy/paste
