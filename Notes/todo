- we need to make the payload that's generated from task trigger_funcs to get to the bot somehow

for example, if we use a halcyon's space_move, on using space_move, it will send:
``` in x hours, the halcyon will move to (x,y) ```

when x hours will up, change_region will be called and all is well

BUT the payload from change_region won't go to the bot, no messages will be sent

MAYBE have check_tasks return all the different payloads and have that go to the bot somehow?


ALSO:
player filtering stuff (some sort of decorator that relies on a common syntax?)

@def player_filter():
    def wrapper()
        args[0].author.uid = player
        if args[1].owner == player # where args[1] is the entity object
